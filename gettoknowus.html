            heyyy thanks for checking out the digital art museum!! i'm a ux design major and want to practice my ux design + coding skillzz while having a space for cool people to put their cool projects! i should be working on my design portfolio right now, but hey! <br><br>oh yes! my interests! well, i love to write poetry, spend time in nature, take photos, strum chords on my acoustic guitar, and color like a little kid. i also am obsessed with my cat, blu. he's an angel that walks upon this earth.

            i'm in the stage of development and would love your suggestions. (i'm in ux guys. i swear the *user* is everything to me). like if you have a cute name for the site or a vibey color scheme, send it on over. ooo maybe i could make a survey hehe for submitting improvement requests. hehe this is so exciting ahhh!! bro, i literally can't do my homework. this is all i can think of rn.<br><br>
