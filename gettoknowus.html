            heyyy thanks for checking out the digital art museum!! i'm a ux design major and want to practice my ux design + coding skillzz while having a space for cool people to put their cool projects! i should be working on my design portfolio right now, but hey! <br><br>oh yes! my interests! well, i love to write poetry, spend time in nature, take photos, strum chords on my acoustic guitar, and color like a little kid. i also am obsessed with my cat, blu. he's an angel that walks upon this earth.
