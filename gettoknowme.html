        <p>hello!<br><br>

            my name is isabella kallieris! thank you for taking the time out of your day to check out my blog. it really means a lot to me. i haven't had a blog since 2019, and i'm not quite sure what happened to that one honestly. it was on wix, and i can't remember my login hehe yay. but yeah, i want this to be a place to put what pops into my brain. rn, i just use letterboxd to do that, but ey upgrades! (also am trying to practice my ux design + coding skillzz) i should be working on my design portfolio right now, but hey! <br><br>oh yes! my interests! well, i love to write poetry, spend time in nature, take photos, strum chords on my acoustic guitar, and color like a little kid. i also am obsessed with my cat, blu. he's an angel that walks upon this earth.
