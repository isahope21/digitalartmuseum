            <h3>a poem written by: molly stilling</h3>

            <p>

                In a sea of sweaty bodies<br>
                Intoxicated and free,<br>
                She stands adjacent with Her drink,<br>
                And She looks up at me<br>
                <br>
                I see Her curled lashes<br>
                Peering at me from above,<br>
                She blushes, Her eyes widen<br>
                Reminiscent of a dove<br><br>
                
                I ask Her what's so funny, <br>
                My hands are in my hair, <br>
                Our hips move everywhere, <br>
                Her giggles stop, She takes a breath <br><br>
                "Nothing, you're just perfect"<br><br>
                There is no way She can understand <br>
                What that has done to me. <br>
                I want to grab Her by the neck<br>
                And kiss Her senselessly <br>
                <br>
                But Her boyfriend in in the corner,<br>
                And I'm reminded, this cannot be.<br><br>
                So now I sit to write,<br>
                About what will not leave my mind.<br>
                Her gaze and words will haunt me,<br>
                For a love I cannot find.<br><br>
